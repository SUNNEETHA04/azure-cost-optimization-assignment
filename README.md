# üíº Azure Cost Optimization: Archive Billing Data from Cosmos DB to Blob Storage

This project automates the archival of billing data from **Azure Cosmos DB** to **Azure Blob Storage** using an **Azure Function App** scheduled via a timer trigger. All resources are deployed using **Terraform**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) installed
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed and logged in
- Active Azure subscription with contributor access

---

## üìå Features

- Provisioning of Azure resources using Terraform
- PowerShell-based Azure Function to move old billing data
- Daily scheduled trigger (adjustable) using `function.json`
- Archived files saved in Azure Blob Storage
- Helps reduce costs by offloading old data from Cosmos DB

---

## üí° What This Project Includes

- **Terraform scripts** to create:
  - Resource Group
  - Cosmos DB
  - Storage Account
  - Azure Function App

- **Azure Function** (PowerShell script):
  - Runs on a schedule (every day)
  - Reads old billing records from Cosmos DB
  - Stores them in a Storage container as JSON files

## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Deploy Infrastructure

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project root directory.  
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize Terraform.  
3. Run `terraform plan` to review planned changes.  
4. Run `terraform apply` to apply changes and create resources.  
5. Confirm with `yes` when prompted.  

### Step 2: Deploy Azure Function Code

1. In Azure Portal, go to your Function App ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí select your function ‚Üí Code + Test tab.  
2. Upload or replace these files:  
   - `archive-billing.ps1`  
   - `function.json`  
3. Navigate to the Configuration tab in your Function App.  
4. Add a new Application Setting:  
   - **Key:** `CosmosDBConnection`  
   - **Value:** Your Cosmos DB connection string (from Azure Portal)  
     > *Find Cosmos DB connection string under Azure Portal ‚Üí Your Cosmos DB ‚Üí Keys*

> **Security Tip:** Do **not** hardcode connection strings inside your PowerShell script.

### Step 3: Monitor & Schedule

1. The Azure Function runs automatically every 24 hours, controlled by `function.json`.  
2. Modify the schedule by editing the CRON expression in `function.json`.  
3. Monitor function executions and logs in Azure Portal under Monitoring or Application Insights.  

### Step 4: Verify Archival

1. Check that billing records older than 3 months have been archived to Blob Storage.  
2. Confirm these records are deleted from Cosmos DB.  
3. Review Function App logs for errors or warnings.

## Cleanup

- To avoid ongoing charges, destroy all created Azure resources using:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

* Confirm the deletion by typing "yes" when prompted. This will clean up all resources provisioned by Terraform.

---

## üîí Security Considerations

* Store sensitive information such as connection strings in Azure Function App Application Settings rather than hardcoding them in scripts.

* For production environments, use Azure Managed Identities combined with Azure Key Vault to securely manage secrets.

* Never commit secrets or credentials to your GitHub repository, especially public ones.

* Regularly review and rotate access keys to minimize risk.

---

## üì¶ Output

* This project ensures that billing records older than 3 months are safely archived as JSON files in Azure Blob Storage.

* Cosmos DB storage size and related costs are significantly reduced, without impacting data availability or API contracts.
